# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-13)

**Core value:** Clients get onboarded without human intervention. The agent asks the right questions through the right channel at the right time, and services get set up automatically.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Security Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Security Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-13 — Roadmap created, all 28 requirements mapped across 8 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Interleave hardening + features per phase — ship usable increments while tightening security progressively
- [Roadmap]: ORG-01/02 placed in Phase 4 (Org Settings) — they are config, not foundational security
- [Roadmap]: ORG-03 (atomic payment handler) placed in Phase 1 — it prevents orphaned records on the same failure surface as the other security fixes
- [Roadmap]: ORG-04 (dead letter queue) placed in Phase 4 — admin UI for DLQ belongs alongside other org operational controls
- [Roadmap]: Phase 7 depends on Phase 1, not Phase 6 — rate limiting and logging can run after security foundation regardless of widget progress

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Vapi webhook signature verification not covered by any requirement — research flagged this. May surface during Phase 1 planning.
- [Phase 2]: `stripe-adapter.ts` may be disconnected from tenant provisioning — requires code inspection before planning Phase 2.
- [Phase 6]: ElevenLabs voice + form hybrid state machine needs design before implementation — complex UX with shared state across mode switches.
- [Phase 7]: Upstash Redis account setup is a deployment dependency — must be provisioned before Phase 7 can ship.
